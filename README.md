📦 Inventory Management System (Core Python)
📌 Introduction

The Inventory Management System is a menu-driven Python application developed using Core Python only.
It helps manage product details such as product ID, name, price, and quantity. The system allows users to add, view, update, delete, and search products efficiently.

This project is created for academic purposes and demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

The program displays a menu with multiple options

User can add products with ID, name, price, and quantity

Inventory data is stored using a dictionary inside a class

User can:

View all products

Update product quantity

Delete a product

Search product by ID or name

View low-stock products

Calculate total inventory value

User can exit the program safely
